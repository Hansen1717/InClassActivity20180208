        My name is Bryan Hansen. I grew up in the southwest suburbs of Chicago. The suburb I hail from is called Orland Park, which is about 35 miles Southwest of the city itself. I moved to Atlanta for an internship
        with a small company called DMA. DMA specializes is retail back office solutions, which is essentially a fancy way of saying managing all the data that goes into running a retail enviroment. This internship turned
        into a full time job and has given me great exposure into the life of devoloper. This exposure has led me to the GT bootcamp, where I will gather the skills to move into a development role.
